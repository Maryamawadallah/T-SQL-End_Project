# T-SQL End Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on testing the understanding and ability to write T-SQL statements for various tasks in SQL Server. A comprehensive set of SQL queries was developed to facilitate essential database operations, including data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting.

The project includes a diverse array of queries that address critical business needs, such as:

- **Data Retrieval**: Extracting detailed information about products, categories, suppliers, and customer orders. This allows for thorough analysis of inventory and sales data, enabling informed decision-making based on current trends.

- **Customer and Employee Analysis**: Identifying key metrics such as total orders placed by customers and overall sales performance by employees. Understanding these metrics helps recognize customer loyalty and evaluate employee contributions to sales.

- **Aggregate Calculations**: Performing calculations like averages, totals, and percentage increases to gain insights into product pricing, sales trends, and performance over time. These calculations are crucial for strategic planning and assessing market conditions.

- **Table Management**: Creating and managing tables for storing specific data, such as customer reviews and monthly sales reports. This enhances the organization and accessibility of data within the database.

- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Implementing stored procedures and functions to streamline repetitive tasks and facilitate efficient data handling. These programming constructs are vital for automating processes and improving overall performance.

Working through these diverse queries provides practical experience in managing and analyzing data within a relational database environment, serving as a foundation for building more complex database applications and analytics in the future.
