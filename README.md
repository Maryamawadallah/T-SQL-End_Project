# T-SQL End Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to test your understanding and ability to write T-SQL statements for various tasks in SQL Server. It encompasses a comprehensive set of SQL queries designed to facilitate essential database operations, including data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting.

Throughout this project, you will engage with a diverse array of queries that address critical business needs. These tasks include:

- **Data Retrieval**: Extracting detailed information about products, categories, suppliers, and customer orders. This allows for a thorough analysis of the inventory and sales data, enabling users to make informed decisions based on current trends.

- **Customer and Employee Analysis**: Identifying key metrics such as total orders placed by customers and overall sales performance by employees. Understanding these metrics helps in recognizing customer loyalty and evaluating employee contributions to sales.

- **Aggregate Calculations**: Performing calculations like averages, totals, and percentage increases to gain insights into product pricing, sales trends, and performance over time. These calculations are crucial for strategic planning and assessing market conditions.

- **Table Management**: Creating and managing tables for storing specific data, such as customer reviews and monthly sales reports. This enhances the organization and accessibility of data within the database.

- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Implementing stored procedures and functions to streamline repetitive tasks and facilitate efficient data handling. These programming constructs are vital for automating processes and improving overall performance.

By working through these diverse queries, you will not only enhance your SQL skills but also gain practical experience in managing and analyzing data within a relational database environment. This project serves as a foundation for building more complex database applications and analytics in the future.
